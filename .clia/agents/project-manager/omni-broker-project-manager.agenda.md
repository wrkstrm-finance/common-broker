# AGENDA — CommonBroker Project Manager

## Near-Term

\- Task breakdown: Public-backed services (Profile, Positions, Activity, Orders) + adapters.
\- Dependencies: PublicLib APIs (done), TradierLib reference (done).
\- Risks: Field normalization differences; ensure adapters consolidate units/timestamps.
\- QA plan: Fixture-driven tests; smoke wiring in example app.

## Mid-Term

- Release management and regression suite.

## Long-Term

- Sustained maintenance and security reviews.
